# Exploratory Data Analysis

The topic of exploratory data analysis is extremely important in discovering and formulating hypotheses.  A key aspect of that process is *visual analytics* or *information visualization*, which allows one to see certain aspects of the data holistically.  This module is focused on such topics.

For those students unfamiliar with basic exploratory data analysis, additional introductory material provide an overview of different types of visualizations to help them better understand the content of the other lectures. Two simple use cases illustrate how data exploration and visualization can be applied to specific data sets.
