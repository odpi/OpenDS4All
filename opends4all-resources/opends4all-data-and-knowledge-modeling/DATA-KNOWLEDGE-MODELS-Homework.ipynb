This function should use the given dataframes and `num` as input and return a three column dataframe: `person_1`, `person_2`, and `common_skills`. The first two columns should be person IDs and the last column should be the number of skills that this pair of people shares.\n","\n","**Hint:** Doing this requires a *Cartesian product*, i.e., every ID paired with every other ID.  Think about how to create a dataframe just with people IDs, then add a field to this dataframe that will let us combine every record with every record."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","deletable":false,"id":"3WGjZh3PUzLw","nbgrader":{"cell_type":"code","checksum":"22181eb8602d0b2a401709ac5df73b69","grade":false,"grade_id":"1-4-1-ans","locked":false,"schema_version":3,"solution":true,"task":false},"colab":{}},"source":["# TODO: Finish the collect_peers function\n","\n","people_df_subset = people_df.head(100)\n","\n","def collect_peers(people_df_subset, skills_df, num):\n","    # YOUR CODE HERE\n","\n"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"code","checksum":"132367adc67515e7bbb972882f47d34a","grade":true,"grade_id":"1-4-1-san","locked":true,"points":2,"schema_version":3,"solution":false,"task":false},"id":"R068G-XjosMd","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Sanity Check 2.4.1 -
