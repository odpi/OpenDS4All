By the end, you'll be a star (not that you aren't already one). Over the next few days you will be using an EMR cluster to use Spark to manipulate the entire `linkedin.json` dataset as well as a new data set, `stock_prices.csv`.\n","\n","The goal of the homework will be to create a training dataset for a Random Forest Machine learning model. The training data set will contain the monthly number of employees hired by companies in `linkedin.json` and their corresponding closing stock prices over a 10 year period (2000-2011). We will try and predict, based on this data, if the company will have a positive or negative growth in stock in the first quarter of the next year. Who's ready to make some money?\n","\n","## The Noteworthy Notes\n","Before we begin here are some important notes to keep in mind,\n","\n","\n","1.   **IMPORTANT!** I said it twice, it's really important. In this homework, we will be using AWS resources. You are given a quota ($150) to use for the entirety of the homework. There is a small chance you will use all this money, however it is important that at the end of every session, you **shut down your EMR cluster**.\n","2.   **You can only use Google Colab for this Homework** since we must connect to the EMR cluster and Jupyter doesn't do that. Using a Google Colab Notebook with an EMR cluster has two important abnormalities:\n","    * The first line of any cell in which you will use the spark session must be `%%spark`. Notice that all cells below have this.\n","    * You will, unfortunately, not be able to stop a cell while it is running. If you wish to do so, you will need to restart your cluster. See the Setup EMR Document for reference.\n","3.   You are **required** to use Spark SQL queries to handle the data in the assignment. Mastering SQL is more beneficial than being able to use Spark commands (functions) as it will show up in more areas of programming and data science/analytics than just Spark. Use the following [function list](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/index.html#) to see all the SQL functions avaliable in Spark.\n","4.
