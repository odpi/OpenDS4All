        "\n",
        "Explainability, one of the five pillars of AI Trust, is the ability to provide a clear and relevant explanation of a model's decision. This explanation is often difficult to provide due to the complexity of model decisions and the diversity of audiences looking for understanding, but the AIX360 package can help.\n",

        "This Notebook steps through using the AIX360 package to explain the data and modeling of UCI's Breast Cancer dataset, a tabular dataset that represents a binary classification problem. It demonstrates looking at data with Protodash and explaining model results with BRCG, LIME, and SHAP.\n",
