# Overview

This project aims to governed in a transparent, accessible way for the benefit of the community. All participation in this project is open and not bound to corporate affiliation. Participants all our bound the project's [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Project roles

## Contributor

The contributor role is the starting role for anyone participating in the project and wishing to contribute code.

# Process for becoming a contributor

* Review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to ensure your contribution is inline with the project's coding and styling guidelines.
* Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO signoff.
* Have you submission approved by the maintainer(s) and merged into the codebase.

## Maintainer

The maintainer role enables the participation to commit code directly to the repository, but also comes with the responsibility of being a responsible leader in the community.

### Process for becoming a maintainer

* Show your experience with the codebase through contributions and engagement on the community channels.
* Request to become a maintainer.
* Have the majority of maintainers approve you becoming a maintainer.
* Your name and email is added to the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file for the project.

### Maintainer responsibilities

* Monitor email aliases.
* Monitor Slack (delayed response is perfectly acceptable).
* Triage GitHub issues and perform pull request reviews for other maintainers and the community.
* Make sure that ongoing PRs are moving forward at the right pace or closing them.
* In general continue to be willing to spend at least 25% of ones time working on the project (~1.25 business days per week).

### When does a maintainer lose maintainer status

If a maintainer is no longer interested or cannot perform the maintainer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the maintainers per the voting process below.

## TSC

The TSC will consist of maintainers that will provide overall direction and leadership to the project. The TSC will elect a chairperson ( and optionally a co-chairperson ) which will be the primary point of contact for the project and representative to the ODPi TSC. The chairperson will be responsible for the overall project health and direction, coordination of activities, and working with other projects and committees as needed for the continued growth of the project. New TSC members can be added with a supermajority vote of the current TSC members.

Current TSC members are:

- Susan Davidson
- Andre de Waal (chairperson) 
- Zack Ives 
- Kinga Szekessy 
- ana M echeverri 
- James Harroun

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the maintainers.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the maintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each maintainer receives one vote.

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the Code of Conduct, this project will:

* Keep all communication on open channels ( mailing list, forums, chat ).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members ( such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc ).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the maintainers.
