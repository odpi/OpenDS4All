### When does a committer lose committer status

If a committer is no longer interested or cannot perform the committer duties listed above, they
should volunteer to be moved to emeritus status. In extreme cases this can also occur by a vote of
the committers per the voting process below.

## TSC

The TSC will consist of committers that will provide overall direction and leadership to the project. The TSC will elect a chairperson ( and optionally a co-chairperson ) which will be the primary point of contact for the project and representative to the ODPi TSC. The chairperson will be responsible for the overall project health and direction, coordination of activities, and working with other projects and committees as needed for the continued growth of the project. New TSC members can be added with a supermajority vote of the current TSC members.

Current TSC members are:

- Andre de Waal ( chairperson )
- Susan Davidson
- Zack Ives  
- Ana Echeverri 
- James Harroun
- Goutam Chakraborty
- Jennifer Priestley
- Aric LaBarr
- David Mongeau

# Release Process

Project releases will occur on a scheduled basis as agreed to by the maintainers.

# Conflict resolution and voting

In general, we prefer that technical issues and maintainer membership are amicably worked out
between the persons involved. If a dispute cannot be decided independently, the maintainers can be
called in to decide an issue. If the maintainers themselves cannot decide an issue, the issue will
be resolved by voting. The voting process is a simple majority in which each maintainer receives one vote.

# Communication

This project, just like all of open source, is a global community. In addition to the Code of Conduct, this project will:

* Keep all communication on open channels ( mailing list, forums, chat ).
* Be respectful of time and language differences between community members ( such as scheduling meetings, email/issue responsiveness, etc ).
* Ensure tools are able to be used by community members regardless of their region.

If you have concerns about communication challenges for this project, please contact the maintainers.
